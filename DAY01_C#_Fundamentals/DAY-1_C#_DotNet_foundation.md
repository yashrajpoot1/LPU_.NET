# C# and .NET Framework Overview

## 1. C#

**C# (C-Sharp)** is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used for building Windows applications, web services, enterprise software, and cross-platform applications using the .NET ecosystem. C# supports structured, component-oriented, and asynchronous programming paradigms.

---

## 2. .NET Framework

The **.NET Framework** is a software development platform developed by Microsoft that provides a controlled runtime environment and a comprehensive class library. It enables developers to build, deploy, and run applications consistently across different systems.

### Key components:

* **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
* **Base Class Library (BCL)**
* **Language interoperability support**

## 3. How .NET Works

The execution of a .NET program follows a structured pipeline:

1. **Source Code Compilation**
   The C# source code is compiled by the C# compiler (`csc`) into **Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL)**.

2. **Intermediate Language Storage**
   The compiled MSIL is stored in an assembly (`.exe` or `.dll`) along with metadata.

3. **Runtime Execution**
   At runtime, the **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** converts MSIL into native machine code using **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**.

4. **Managed Execution**
   The CLR manages memory, exception handling, security, and garbage collection.

## 4. MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)

**MSIL** is a CPU-independent set of instructions generated by .NET language compilers. It acts as an intermediate representation between high-level source code and machine-specific code, enabling language interoperability and platform independence.

---

## 5. CLS (Common Language Specification)

The **Common Language Specification (CLS)** is a set of rules and guidelines that .NET languages must follow to ensure cross-language compatibility. Code that follows CLS rules can be used seamlessly across different .NET programming languages.

---

## 6. CLR (Common Language Runtime)

The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the execution engine of the .NET Framework. It provides essential services such as:

* Memory management
* Garbage collection
* Type safety
* Exception handling
* Security enforcement
* JIT compilation

## 7. C# Program: Prime Number Check

### Description

The following C# program checks whether a given number is **prime**. It uses optimized logic by checking divisibility only up to the square root of the number.

### Source Code

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.Write("Enter your number: ");
        int n = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        if (n <= 1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Not a Prime");
            return;
        }

        if (n == 2 || n == 3)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("It's a Prime");
            return;
        }

        if (n % 2 == 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Not a Prime");
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 3; i * i <= n; i += 2)
        {
            if (n % i == 0)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Not a Prime");
                return;
            }
        }

        Console.WriteLine("It's a Prime");
    }
}
```

```csharp simple programm
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Enter Your Age: ");
        string? input = Console.ReadLine();

        if (int.TryParse(input, out int age))
        {
            bool isAdult = age >= 18;
            Console.WriteLine("Adult? " + isAdult);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid Age");
        }
    }
}

```


```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        const double n = 30.48;
        Console.WriteLine("Enter feet value: ");
        string? feet = Console.ReadLine();

        if (!double.TryParse(feet, out double f))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Invalid number");
            return;
        }

        if (f < 0)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Input is sort");
        }

        double cm = f * n;
        Console.WriteLine(f +" Feet in Cm is " + cm);

    }
}

```

## 8. Conclusion

C# and the .NET Framework together provide a robust, secure, and efficient environment for application development. Features such as MSIL, CLS, and CLR ensure platform independence, language interoperability, and managed execution, making .NET suitable for both academic study and enterprise-level software development.
